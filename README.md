# Ravaged Planets
A real-time strategy game for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

This project is based off a very old project I semi-abandoned several years ago, andjust happen to have the source code still lying around. The original project ran on Windows only (it used DirectX for rendering) and it relied pretty heavily on CEGUI for rendering the UI. You can see a video of it here:

The original source code was never public, and I plan to basically slowly cut'n'paste that code as I go here bringing the project into the modern era as a cross-platform OpenGL 3.x application. The name is changed from War Worlds to differentiate it from another project I have which I also (imaginatively) called [War Worlds](http://www.war-worlds.com).
